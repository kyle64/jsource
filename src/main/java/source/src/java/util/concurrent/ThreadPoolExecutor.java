/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link Executors} factory methods.
 *
 * 为什么需要线程池？
 * 线程池能够对线程进行统一分配，调优和监控：
 * - 降低资源消耗（线程无限制地创建，然后使用完毕后销毁）
 * - 提高响应速度（无须创建线程）
 * - 提高线程的可管理性
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 *
 * 线程池主要处理两个问题。
 * 一是处理大量异步任务的性能表现；二是执行一组任务时的资源限制和管理。
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link Executors} factory methods {@link
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 *
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 * pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by
 * corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 * maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
 *
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 * created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 * idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 * maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 * if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 * the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 * maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 * number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 * sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 * dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 * #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
 *
 * <dd>By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link
 * #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 * you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a {@link ThreadFactory}.  If not
 * otherwise specified, a {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 * used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
 * ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 * non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 * by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 * continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 * should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 * worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 * permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 * take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 * state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)}).
 * This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 * pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 * later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 * changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 * TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
 * TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 * terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 * applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads. But
 * method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to
 * apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 * keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 *
 * 当线程池中的线程数超过核心线程数大小时，如果超出的线程已经空闲了超过keep-alive时间的话，就会被终止。
 * 这样主要是为了减少资源小号，如果后续需要更多线程，到时候再创建。
 * allowCoreThreadTimeOut方法可以是超时参数对核心线程生效。
 *
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 *
 * 阻塞队列主要用于转移和持有已提交的任务。通常和线程池大小有关。
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.</li>
 *
 * 如果当前运行的线程数少于corePoolSize，那么Executor就会创建新的线程，而非加入队列。
 *
 * <li> If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.</li>
 *
 * 如果当前运行的线程数大于等于corePoolSize，那么Executor就会将请求加入队列。
 *
 * <li> If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.</li>
 *
 * 如果一个请求无法加入队列，那么Executor就会创建新的线程直到线程数超过maximumPoolSize最大线程数，然后任务就会被拒绝。
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * 优先级：核心线程 -> 阻塞队列 -> 最大线程 -> 拒绝策略
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * SynchronousQueue同步队列不持有任务，如果没有足够的线程的话，任务插入队列会直接失败，然后创建新的节点。
 * 这种策略避免了多个请求之间有依赖时的查找；通常不设置最大线程数maximumPoolSizes上限。
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * LinkedBlockingQueue无界队列。不会创建超过核心线程数的线程。适合任务间相互独立的场景，如web服务器。
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.  </li>
 *
 * ArrayBlockingQueue有界队列。使用有限的最大线程数来防止资源饥饿，但是难以调整和控制，队列大小和线程最大值需要平衡。
 * 使用大队列+小线程池：减少CPU使用、操作系统资源、用户态／内核态切换，但减少吞吐量。
 * 使用小队列+大线程池：CPU更忙碌，可能遇到更多scheduling的消耗，同样降低吞吐量。
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 * 拒绝任务
 *
 * <dd>New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)} will be
 * <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 * the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 * capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 * invokes the {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 * method of its {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 * policies are provided:
 *
 * Executor shutdown 或者 线程数超过最大线程数和有界队列时触发。
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> In the default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the
 * handler throws a runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon
 * rejection. </li>
 *
 * AbortPolicy抛出异常
 *
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 * simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 * new tasks are submitted. </li>
 *
 * CallerRunsPolicy谁调用谁跑这个线程
 *
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 * cannot be executed is simply dropped.  </li>
 *
 * DiscardPolicy丢弃任务
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 * executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 * is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 * causing this to be repeated.) </li>
 *
 * DiscardOldestPolicy将队列头部的任务放弃
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 *
 * <dd>This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 * {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 * before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 * manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 * Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 *
 * <p>If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker
 * threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Method {@link #getQueue()} allows access to the work queue
 * for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 * any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 * {@link #remove(Runnable)} and {@link #purge} are available to
 * assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 * become cancelled.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Finalization</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
 * you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
 * if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
 * that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
 * keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 * setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd>
 *
 * 线程池只有不被引用 且 没有任何剩余线程时 才会被自动shutdown
 *
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
 *
 *   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
 *     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *       t.interrupt();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void pause() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = true;
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void resume() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = false;
 *       unpaused.signalAll();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }

public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {
    /**
     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     *   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     *   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     * ctl包含两个属性，有效线程数 和 线程池运行状态
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     *
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *   能接收任务且能处理阻塞队列中的任务
     *
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *   不能接收新任务，但可以处理队列中的任务
     *
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *   不接收新任务，不处理队列任务。
     *
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *   所有任务都终止
     *
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *   终止完成，什么都不做
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     *
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
     * below).

    /**
     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and
     * executes them, while coping with a number of issues:
     * 循环的从队列中获取任务并执行
     *
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 从一个初始化的任务开始，不需要获取第一个任务 ？
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 运行一个任务前，先获取锁，以防其他任务执行时中断线程池；这样的话，只要线程池不停止，当前线程就不会中断
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 执行beforeExecute
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 执行任务的run方法，可能抛出异常，由于Runnable不能重新抛出Throwable异常，所以会封装在Errors中抛出
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * task.run执行完毕后，调用afterExecute
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
